# Protein Grapher: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Protein Grapher, an easy-to-use application designed to help you understand how drugs interact with plasma proteins within cells.

## What It Does

Protein Grapher is a tool that shows you the journey a drug protein takes to connect with all the plasma proteins in a cell.

## Key Features

- Works with multiple drug proteins simultaneously
- Provides the results in a simple CSV file format

## How to Get Started

1. **Download the Program**: Go to the Releases Page and download the version that matches your operating system.

2. **Prepare Your Files** (Optional): If you have route, plasma protein, and source files, create a folder named `db` and place these files inside it.

3. **Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the program and your files.

4. **Run the Program**: Use the following command:

```bash
./protein-grapher --routes=<path to routes csv file> --plasma=<path to plasma csv file> --sources=<path to sources csv file>
```
Replace `<path to routes csv file>`, `<path to plasma csv file>`, and `<path to sources csv file>` with the actual paths to your files.

That's it! You're ready to explore the fascinating world of protein interactions with Protein Grapher. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy graphing! ðŸ§¬
